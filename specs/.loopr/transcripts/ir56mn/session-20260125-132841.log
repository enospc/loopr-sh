[1m[4mOptions:[0m
  [1m-c[0m, [1m--config[0m <key=value>
          Override a configuration value that would otherwise be loaded from `~/.codex/config.toml`.
          Use a dotted path (`foo.bar.baz`) to override nested values. The `value` portion is parsed
          as TOML. If it fails to parse as TOML, the raw string is used as a literal.
          
          Examples: - `-c model="o3"` - `-c 'sandbox_permissions=["disk-full-read-access"]'` - `-c
          shell_environment_policy.inherit=all`

      [1m--enable[0m <FEATURE>
          Enable a feature (repeatable). Equivalent to `-c features.<name>=true`

      [1m--disable[0m <FEATURE>
          Disable a feature (repeatable). Equivalent to `-c features.<name>=false`

  [1m-i[0m, [1m--image[0m <FILE>...
          Optional image(s) to attach to the initial prompt

  [1m-m[0m, [1m--model[0m <MODEL>
          Model the agent should use

      [1m--oss[0m
          Convenience flag to select the local open source model provider. Equivalent to -c
          model_provider=oss; verifies a local LM Studio or Ollama server is running

      [1m--local-provider[0m <OSS_PROVIDER>
          Specify which local provider to use (lmstudio, ollama, or ollama-chat). If not specified
          with --oss, will use config default or show selection

  [1m-p[0m, [1m--profile[0m <CONFIG_PROFILE>
          Configuration profile from config.toml to specify default options

  [1m-s[0m, [1m--sandbox[0m <SANDBOX_MODE>
          Select the sandbox policy to use when executing model-generated shell commands
          
          [possible values: read-only, workspace-write, danger-full-access]

  [1m-a[0m, [1m--ask-for-approval[0m <APPROVAL_POLICY>
          Configure when the model requires human approval before executing a command

          Possible values:
          - [1muntrusted[0m:  Only run "trusted" commands (e.g. ls, cat, sed) without asking for user
            approval. Will escalate to the user if the model proposes a command that is not in the
            "trusted" set
          - [1mon-failure[0m: Run all commands without asking for user approval. Only asks for approval if
            a command fails to execute, in which case it will escalate to the user to ask for
            un-sandboxed execution
          - [1mon-request[0m: The model decides when to ask the user for approval
          - [1mnever[0m:      Never ask for user approval Execution failures are immediately returned to
            the model

      [1m--full-auto[0m
          Convenience alias for low-friction sandboxed automatic execution (-a on-request, --sandbox
          workspace-write)

      [1m--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox[0m
          Skip all confirmation prompts and execute commands without sandboxing. EXTREMELY
          DANGEROUS. Intended solely for running in environments that are externally sandboxed

  [1m-C[0m, [1m--cd[0m <DIR>
          Tell the agent to use the specified directory as its working root

      [1m--search[0m
          Enable live web search. When enabled, the native Responses `web_search` tool is available
          to the model (no per‑call approval)

      [1m--add-dir[0m <DIR>
          Additional directories that should be writable alongside the primary workspace

      [1m--no-alt-screen[0m
          Disable alternate screen mode
          
          Runs the TUI in inline mode, preserving terminal scrollback history. This is useful in
          terminal multiplexers like Zellij that follow the xterm spec strictly and disable
          scrollback in alternate screen buffers.

  [1m-h[0m, [1m--help[0m
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')

  [1m-V[0m, [1m--version[0m
          Print version
